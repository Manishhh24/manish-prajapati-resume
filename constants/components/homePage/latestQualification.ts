      `I worked with TechStaunch Software Solutions Pvt. Ltd. as a ReactJS Intern. In my initial days, I strengthened my concepts of JavaScript (Asynchronous, Fetch, & Axios too), TypeScript, SCSS, TailwindCSS and ReactJS. I also learnt GraphQL, ApolloClient, RelayJS and NextJS framework.
       I also implemented small project like practicals while learning them. Then, I was assigned a role on my Company's website to improve loading of pages, i.e. page speed optimizations; corrected some functionalities to work again like going on to next page of form when something is selected, 
       and developed some pages. After 4 months from my joining, I was asked to be on a client-side project, where, I did API integrations and for that used RelayJS, corrected some functionalities and did some refining work on designs. And, in my last month of Internship, I made reusable components in NextJS 
       framework, like reusable react-table, react-slider, etc.
